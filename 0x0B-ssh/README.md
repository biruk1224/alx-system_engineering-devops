### Tasks
### Use a private key
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.
### Create an SSH key pair
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
###  Client configuration file
Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.
### Let me in!
Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.
